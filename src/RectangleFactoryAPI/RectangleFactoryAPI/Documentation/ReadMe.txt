RectangleFactoryAPI - ASP.Net Web API

RUNNING SOLUTION:
	After cloning the solution from https://stipsmoosh@bitbucket.org/stipsmoosh/derivco.git
	If rebuilding solution fails: the references probably have not been included (This is typical fo visual studio). Please close the solution and re-open it. The references should now be included and the solution should build.

TESTING:
	A Postman v2.1 collection of test requests can be found in RectangleFactoryAPI.Tests layer, Postman folder

Solution outline:
	Class libraries:
		Algorithms: Algorithm types to be added here. Currently contains only MyRectangleAlgorithm type.
		Decorators: Decorators extending the functionality of basic geometry types for execution of algorithm.
		DTO: Data transfer types to be added here. Currently only contains RectangleFactoryController input request.
		Geometry: Geometric structure types.
		Interfaces: Interfaces used throughout the solution.
		Storage: Static dictionary used to impersonate persistence of Geometry.

CONFIG: 
	Web.config:
		MaxRectangleDimensionLimit - dimension limit of rectangles, defaulted to 100
		MyRectangleAlgorithmMinInputRequest - minimum number of rectangles to be generated
		MyRectangleAlgorithmMaxInputRequest - maximum number of rectangles to be generated

RectangleFactoryAPI - Web API:
Project Url: http://localhost:44322/
RectangleFactoryController.cs:	
	POST requests:
		1) "api/RectangleFactory/GenerateRectangles": 
			Endpoint used to generate dataset that algorithm will run against.
			Pushes algorithm instance to storage layer upon completion.

			sample input request body:
			{
				"rectangleCreationNumber" : 20
			}
			where rectangleCreationNumber type int specifies number of rectangles to generate for algorithm to run against.

	GET requests:
		2) "api/RectangleFactory/FactoryOutput/Current" - returns data from current (most recent) algorithm instance, generated by enpoint 1
		3) "api/RectangleFactory/FactoryOutput/RectangleCreationNumber/{rectangleCreationNumber}/Search" - searches for algorithm instance in storage with rectangleCreationNumber, generated by endpoint 1
			
	sample output for rectangleCreationNumber equal set to 4, for all three endpoints:

				"Input": [
					{
						"X": 0,
						"Y": 0,
						"Height": 88,
						"Width": 3

				],
				"Output": [
